Problem Statement - Despite the critical role of agriculture in sustaining communities and economies, farmers as well as domestic cultivators encounter significant hurdles. They face challenges in selecting the most suitable crops to grow, diagnosing issues with their crops, and accessing the necessary products for cultivation. Limited access to relevant information, personalized guidance, and a platform for purchasing farming-related products restricts farmers' ability to make informed decisions. This often leads to suboptimal crop choices and reduced yields.

Proposed Solution :
> Diagnosing crop issues: facilitates the identification and diagnosis of crop issues through uploaded images. Subsequently, it retrieves relevant information about the specific disease by conducting searches on the internet.
> Crop recommendation system: Recommends suitable crops based on location, soil type, climate, and market trends.
> Personalized guidance: Provides tailored advice on cultivation practices, scheduling, irrigation, fertilization, and pest control.
> Web3 based E-commerce platform: Facilitates easy procurement of farming supplies, including seeds, fertilizers, and equipment.
> Other features like community support and latest updates about government policies can be added in the future as per the needs of the project.

Conclusion - In conclusion, our Web3 based integrated platform challenges for both farmers and domestic cultivators by diagnosing crop issues, providing a crop recommendation, personalized guidance, and an e-commerce platform. By leveraging data and tailored advice, we empower farmers to make informed decisions, optimize yields, and access necessary supplies easily. Our aim is to revolutionize agriculture, making it more sustainable and enhancing global food security.
